# "String Concatenation!" Challenge
=begin
 John wanted to concatenate two strings in C as a part of his school assignment. But, he isn't being able to do so.
 
 He requires your help to write a program in C that takes two strings from the user, and then returns an output concatenating those two strings.
 
 Can you help him? The first person to write a program for his problem and create a PR for it would have his/her PR merged.
