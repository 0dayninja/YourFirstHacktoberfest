# "String Concatenation!" Challenge
=begin
 John wanted to concatenate two strings in Ruby as a part of his school assignment. But, he isn't being able to do so.
 
 He requires your help to write a program in Ruby that takes two strings from the user, and then returns an output concatenating those two strings.
 
 Can you help him? The first person to write a program for his problem and create a PR for it would have his/her PR merged.

# Write your program here!

# taking first string object 
str1 = "Hello"
# taking second string object
str2 = " everyone!"

# using the concat method 
str1.concat(str2) 
   
# displaying the output 
puts str1
