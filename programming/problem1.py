# "Hello, World!" Challenge
"""
	Hello there,
	
	I wanted to write a program in Python 3 that would print "Hello, world!", but it is instead printing "Hi, world!". Would you mind fixing this problem?
	
	The first person to do so in the correct way and create a PR for it would be eligible for his/her PR to be merged.
	
	Thanks,
	Binit Ghimire
